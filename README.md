# SnakeGameWeb

This project was to help me further my understnaing of web programming. It will also extended my knowledge of the
canvas element and proficiency with javascript.

I created a simple retro snake game variation. You use the arrow keys or w,a,s,d keys to control the snakes direction.
The aim is to eat as many purple berries as possible. Each berry eaten makes the snake longer by 1 tile. The score 
increments by each time you eat ta berry. Going off one edge makes you enter at the opposite edge. Running into your
tail makes you lose the game. Your score is recorded on the highscores list. Only the top 5 scores stay recorded.

The game behaiour is coded with javascript and jquerey. The structure done with html and the page was styled in css.
